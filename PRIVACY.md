*Last updated: January 6, 2026*

## Overview

InSearch is a Chrome extension that enhances your LinkedIn job search experience. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data and protect your privacy.

## Data Collection

### What We DON'T Collect

- Personal information (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.)
- Browsing history or search queries
- Location data or GPS information
- Analytics or tracking data
- Any data transmission to external servers
- LinkedIn login credentials or profile data
- URL navigation patterns or page visit information

### What We Store Locally

- Your saved search configurations
- Extension settings and preferences (including news feed blocking preference)
- Company blocklist (stored in your browser only)
- Saved job search criteria

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API. **No data ever leaves your device or browser.** There are no external servers, cloud storage, or data transmission.

## News Feed Blocking Feature

### What It Does
The "Block News Feed" feature helps you stay focused on job searching by automatically redirecting you from LinkedIn's news feed to the jobs page.

### Data Collection
- Monitors your current LinkedIn URL when the feature is enabled
- Stores your on/off preference locally in Chrome storage
- No URL data or browsing patterns are transmitted externally

### How It Works
- Checks your current page URL every 500ms (only while feature is enabled)
- Detects when you navigate to LinkedIn's news feed
- Displays an overlay notification for 2.5 seconds
- Automatically redirects you to the jobs search page
- All processing happens locally in your browser

### Your Control
- Toggle the feature on/off anytime through the extension popup
- Your preference is saved locally and persists across sessions
- Disabling stops all URL monitoring immediately

### Privacy Guarantee
We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any information about:
- Which pages you visit
- How often you visit the news feed
- When the redirect occurs
- Your browsing patterns

This feature operates entirely within your browser with zero external communication.
